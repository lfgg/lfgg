        <h1>About LFGG</h1>
        <p>Luigi's Fan Game Gallery is a community dedicated to preserving and further developing the art of fan games. With our wide variety of skills and passions, we aim to bring each other's projects to life. We welcome contributors of any kind, including programmers, artists, musicians, writers, critics, and anyone else with great ideas. People of all skill levels are encouraged to join and hone their talents.</p>
        <h2>Our Storied Past</h2>
        <p>Inspired by our lengthy time over the years in the Mario fan games community, <a href="https://www.mfgg.net">Mario Fan Games Galaxy</a>, we wanted a place where we could engage with developers and enthusiasts beyond the Mario community and feature their works. We especially wanted to feature fan works from other Nintendo fan game communities who had vanished from the internet such as Metroid: Fan Mission and Zelda Fan Game Network. With your help, we can do that!</p>
        <p>With some of us being former staff at other fan game communities, we hope to bring the best of our experiences there to the table as well as putting our own spin on what a fan game community is like!</p>
