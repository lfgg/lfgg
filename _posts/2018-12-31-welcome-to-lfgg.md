December was an exciting time for LFGG, mostly because LFGG was envisioned and created entirely within that month!

<h2>What is Luigi's Fan Game Gallery?</h2>
Inspired by our lengthy time over the years in the Mario fan games community, Mario Fan Games Galaxy, we wanted a place where we could engage with developers and enthusiasts beyond the Mario community and feature their works. We especially wanted to feature fan works from other Nintendo fan game communities who had vanished from the internet such as Metroid: Fan Mission and Zelda Fan Game Network. With your help, we can do that!

Our mission is to preserve and further develop the art of fan games. With our wide variety of skills and passions, we aim to bring each other's projects to life!

<h2>Looking for fan content and resources to feature!</h2>
We are looking to feature fellow fans and their content in our community and our newsletter whether it be pixel art, their first Mario platformer or their latest build of their Metroidvania project! Not only that, but we aim to share game development resources and tutorials by you and our affiliates!

<h2>All aboard for a fun community!</h2>
We may be most interested in sharing fan works and discussing game development, but it's not all serious business! Check out our Discord server and forums for a variety of activities, games and topics!

<h2>Why Luigi?</h2>
Luigi is underrated and constantly overshadowed by his more popular brother, but Luigi still stays true to his own colors and even goes on his own adventures! He may be Player 2, but much like official content and fan-made content, he and Mario are better together! So who better to represent the symbiotic relationship between official content and its fans than Luigi?
