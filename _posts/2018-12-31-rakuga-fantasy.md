I feel like few games nail an aesthetic as firmly as Rakuga Fantasy. The old-timey 3D maze, goopy green Game Boy pallet and jamming chiptune beats come together to make for a very comfy experience.

You, the player, are tasked with exploring a maze-like labyrinth, grabbing wacky treasures and fighting goofy (and charming) enemies. The dungeon crawling is standard but where this game really shines is the battle system! You attack by completing micro-games ala Warioware. Successfully completing the micro-game damages your opponent, but failing the event allows them to damage you!

While getting used to all of the possible mini games is daunting at first (they are often given little time to assess and react accordingly), persistent players are rewarded with a goofy, satisfying experience that absolutely oozes charm! My personal favorite mini game set are the fast food games and my favorite treasure is the "Slippery Iced Tea". A plethora of clever puns, cute visuals and a certain 'imposing figure' awaits you in Stungun's Rakuga Fantasy!
